# Project Proposal  

### 1. What is the purpose of your research project?  

The purpose of our research project is to inform others what they can do to prevent hearing loss in life and promote hearing loss prevention initiatives. Hearing is essential for maintaining relationships and connections with friends and family, fully participating in team and community activities, and experiencing life events. Hearing makes it possible to engage, listen, laugh, and enjoy many of the things that help shape your quality of life.  

### 2. What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works, as well as a summary of what that work has discovered.  

Research 1: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK385309/>  

"This chapter begins with an overview of data on the incidence and prevalence of hearing loss in adults and a discussion of the factors associated with the risk for hearing loss in adults and methods for prevention. Subsequent sections discuss the impact of hearing loss on individuals, their families, and society...To develop a full understanding of the public health burden of hearing loss in adults in the United States, the committee gathered information from multiple sources in order to determine the extent to which the U.S. population is affected by hearing loss and the impact of those losses. The data suggest that the risk of hearing loss increases across the lifespan and throughout older age and that men have a higher risk of hearing loss than women do."  

Research 2: <https://www.news-medical.net/health/Hearing-Loss-Research.aspx>  

"This article discusses the causes, treatments, and current research on hearing loss. In 2005, gene therapy was experimented on guinea pigs to cure deafness. This therapy was found to promote the regrowth of hair cells that recorded sound in the cochlea. This experiment gave hope for the development of the same procedure in humans. In 2008, a similar method was used in mice, in which in utero gene transfer of Atoh1 initiated the growth of functional auditory hair cells in the cochlea. These new hair cells were capable of mechanoelectrical transduction. The researchers found that controlling the fate of the cell by misexpression of the transcription factor can produce functional sensory cells in the cochlea of mammals."

Research 3: <https://hsci.harvard.edu/hearing-loss-0>  

"Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI) investigators have made it their mission to develop new ways to prevent and treat hearing loss. The researchers are quickly progressing in their goal to replace audio-assistive devices with biologically based therapies that treat the cause of the disease by protecting or replacing lost cells in the ear. HSCI scientists have discovered which stem cells can become hair cells as well as the molecules that bring about this change. Using this information, the researchers are developing techniques to grow hair cells in the laboratory and implant them into the ear."

### 3. What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be. You must find at least two data sources at this stage.  

Data Source 1: <https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/data/datasets/sd-1003-2019-0/default.html>  
Data Source 2: <https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/data/datasets/sd-1001-2014-0/default.html>  
Both of these datasets came from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). They both are supposed to determine the prevalance and occurence of hearing loss in certain industries.   

### 4. Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences. 

Source: <https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss#:~:text=It%20is%20one%20of%20the,than%2075%20have%20difficulty%20hearing.>

It is one of the most common conditions affecting older and elderly adults. Approximately one in three people in the United States between the ages of 65 and 74 has hearing loss, and nearly half of those older than 75 have difficulty hearing." Having trouble hearing can make it hard to understand and follow a doctor's advice, respond to warnings, and hear cell phones, doorbells, and smoke alarms. Hearing loss can also make it hard to enjoy talking with family and friends, leading to feelings of isolation.


### 5. What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)  

We want our audience to avoid loud noises, reducing the amount of time you're exposed to loud noise, and protecting your ears with ear plugs or earmuffs are easy things you can do to protect your hearing and limit the amount of hearing you might lose as you get older. Our data will answer questions related to preventing hearing loss and taking actions that will help protect your hearing long term.  

# Technical description:
### 1. What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?  
The format of our final product will most likely be a Shiny app or an HTML page / .RMD file. We have all taken INFO 201 where we practiced creating a Shiny app so we are hoping to utilize those skills and create something special for this course.  

### 2. Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?    
Currently, we are not anticipating any specific data collection challenges. We found many resources- researches and studies that have been done on this topic and we will be using those to take our project forward.
We will reach out to the teaching team in case we face any data collection / data management challenges.     

### 3. What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?
Presently, we believe we have the technical skills we need in order to complete our project because of previous knowledge from courses such as INFO 201 and INFO 340. We might need to refresh our memory and revisit a few topics but I think we are prepared to complete this project as a team.  

### 4. What major challenges do you anticipate?   
In terms of the project, we don't expect any major challenges. One of our group members might not be very technical but we don't see that being too big of a challenge because we will help each other and divide the work equally and in a way where everyone can showcase their strengths. 
In terms of the group, we are anticipating challenges for meeting times as some of our group members are working full-time or part-time jobs and since it is our last quarter and we are working on capstone project, it might get difficult to meet and discuss a few things some weeks but I think we will be able to make it work as long as we keep communicating throughout the quarter. 
We will reach out to the teaching team in case we run into any major issues that will prevent us from finishing our project.
