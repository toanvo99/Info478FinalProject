## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Set up
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
# Load data
hearing_data <- read.csv("Paper1_WebData_Final.csv")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
head(hearing_data)
hearing_data2 = na.omit(hearing_data)
l500k <- hearing_data$L500k

r500k <- hearing_data$R500k

clean_l500k <- na.omit(l500k)
clean_r500k <- na.omit(r500k)
mean500 <- mean(x = sort(x = clean_l500k)[-c(1, length(x = clean_l500k))])
median500 <- median(clean_l500k)
max500 <- max(clean_l500k)
min500 <- min(clean_l500k)
sd500 <- sd(clean_l500k)
```
- Mean of Left Ear hearing threshold value for 500 hz frequency is `r mean500`
- Median of Left Ear hearing threshold value for 500 hz frequency is `r median500`
- Max of Left Ear hearing threshold value for 500 hz frequency is `r max500`
- Min of Left Ear hearing threshold value for 500 hz frequency is `r min500`
- Standard Deviation of Left Ear hearing threshold value for 500 hz frequency is `r sd500`

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Graph showing the distribution of Left ear hearing threshold value for 500 Hz frequency Each interval of 5 represents the hearing level in decibals (dB), less meaning it's better. When above 25 dB, that means that a worker is said to have developed 'material hearing impairment'. Each bucket represents the total number of people who had a hearing level at 500 hz frequency.  

p <- ggplot(hearing_data2, aes(x=L500k)) + geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white", breaks = seq(5, 40, by = 5))
p
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Find top 10 jobs to show the means, then you can come up with a relationship graph
industry <- hearing_data %>% group_by(NAICS_descr)
industry %>% summarise(
  l500k = mean(L500k)
)
```
